# Election_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to submit an election audit for Coloradoâ€™s congressional races. The goal of the python code is to create code which will work with local and U.S. senate (for Colorado) races as well. An audit is conducted to ensure the votes in an election cycle were counted correctly. The audit is one of the most significant aspects to an election so politicians are not wrongly elected. This analysis of this audit will walk through the steps we created to automate a process to ensure the election went smoothly and no ballots were counted twice or that no ballot was left uncounted.

## Election-Audit Results
### How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
* Using total_votes as a variable to contain the total number of votes. I set the variable to 0 before automating the process, I used the following code to find that 369,711 total votes were casted in this election:

### Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
* 38855 votes were casted in Jefferson County (10.51% of the total votes), 306055 votes were casted in Denver County (82.78% of the total votes), and 24801 votes were casted in Arapahoe County (6.71% of the total votes). I found this by adding in a list of counties. The code would loop through the rows and display counties which had not been repeated. It would then add a vote per each county name. For the second block of code, I divided each county's numbers by total_votes variable and multiplied this number by 100 to find the percentage. I used the following code block for this analysis:

along with this block of code:

### Which county had the largest number of votes?
Denver county had the highest voter turnout with 306055 votes. I found this by creating variables for the county with the highest voter turnout and one for how many voters voted in this particular county. I, then, used a conditional statement to compare each county. If the county it was looking at had the highest voter turnout, it would add that as the largest_county variable until it went to the next county. After completing through all three counties, the largest county would be displayed when executing the python code. I used the following code block:

### Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
I found Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 or 23.0% of the total votes, Diana DeGette received 272,892 or 73.8% of the total votes, and Raymon Anthony Doane 11,606 received 3.1% of the total votes. I used a list (candidate_options) to hold the three candidates names and a dictionary (cadidate_votes) to hold the name as the key and the number of votes the candidate received as a value. I created a conditional statement to tally each vote per candidate by adding in the name of the candidate to a list and counting their votes; a for loop was used to find the percentage for each candidate. The code is as follows:
