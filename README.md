# Election_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to submit an election audit for Coloradoâ€™s congressional races. The goal of the python code is to create code which will work with local and U.S. senate (for Colorado) races as well. An audit is conducted to ensure the votes in an election cycle were counted correctly. The audit is one of the most significant aspects to an election so politicians are not wrongly elected. This analysis of this audit will walk through the steps we created to automate a process to ensure the election went smoothly and no ballots were counted twice or that no ballot was left uncounted.

## Election-Audit Results
### How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
* Using total_votes as a variable to contain the total number of votes. I set the variable to 0 before automating the process, I used the following code to find that 369,711 total votes were casted in this election:

### Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
* 38855 votes were casted in Jefferson County (10.51% of the total votes), 306055 votes were casted in Denver County (82.78% of the total votes), and 24801 votes were casted in Arapahoe County (6.71% of the total votes), I found this by using this block of code:
[votes_per_county] (https://github.com/shireenkahlon/Election_Analysis/blob/main/votes%20per%20county%20screenshot.png)

along with the following code:
